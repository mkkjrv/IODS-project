Data is rolled into one from Math course and Portuguese language course datsets. After the data wrangling exercise the new data set is found from the data folder.
```{r}
student_alc <- read.table("data/student_alc.txt", header = TRUE)
dim(student_alc)
```
The student data includes 35 variables and 382 rows.
```{r}
colnames(student_alc)
```
* The variables not used for joining the two data have been combined by averaging (including the grade variables)
* 'alc_use' is the average of 'Dalc' and 'Walc'
* 'high_use' is TRUE if 'alc_use' is higher than 2 and FALSE otherwise

##High and low alcohol consumption
